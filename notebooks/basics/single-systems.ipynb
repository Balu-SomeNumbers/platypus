    "As well as the assumption that $\\Sigma$ is finite, as mentioned earlier, we naturally assume that $\\Sigma$ is nonempty, as it is nonsensical for a physical system to have no states at all that it can be in.\n",
    "Although it is sensible to consider physical systems having infinitely many classical states, we'll ignore this for now.\n",
    "For the sake of convenience and brevity, we'll use *classical state set* to mean *a finite and nonempty set*.\n",

    "For instance, if $\\mathsf{X}$ is a fan switch, we might happen to know with certainty that it is set to *high*.\n",

    "This may seem trivial, and in some sense it is — but in recognizing this triviality, the analogous behavior for quantum information might seem less unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark concerning measurements of probabilistic states is that probabilistic states describe knowledge or belief, and not necessarily something actual.\n",
    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails and we simply do not know which until we look — and doing so does not actually change the state of the coin, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state of the coin is tails, say, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the probabilistic state $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin — but to someone else in the room who couldn't see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state of the coin would remain unchanged and would be described by the probability vector specified previously.\n",
    "This is not a cause for concern: different individuals may have different knowledge or beliefs about of a particular system, and hence describe that system by different probability vectors."

    "2. The entries in every column sum to 1.\n",
    "Equivalently, stochastic matrices are matrices whose columns all form probability vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about probabilistic operations at an intuitive level as ones where randomness might somehow be used or introduced during the operation, just like in the example above.\n",
    "With respect to the stochastic matrix description of a probabilistic operation, each column can be viewed as a vector representation of the probabilistic state that is generated given whatever classical state input corresponds to that column.\n",
