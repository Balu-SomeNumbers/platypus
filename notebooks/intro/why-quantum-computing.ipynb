    "Seeing as you’ve managed to access this webpage, you should already know what a computer is. Today, computers take many forms: From laptops and phones to the systems controlling traffic lights. It seems computers can do anything! These systems can be very complex and specialised, but they all have one thing in common: A computer carries out a set of instructions on some input information to give us some new (output) information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions we give computers need to be very specific and unambiguous. We call these sets of instructions _algorithms,_ and a lot of the research into computers is into the behaviour of different algorithms. In this course, we will only consider computers in their simplest form; no keyboards, mice, or screens- just information and algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand the role of quantum computers amongst modern traditional computers, we first need to learn how we measure the performance of different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, we classify algorithms on how the [resources](gloss:resources) they use grow with the size of the input. We call this the algorithm’s _complexity_. For example, an algorithm that decides if a number is even only needs to look at the last digit in that number. In this case, the ‘input’ is a number, and the output is either ‘Even’ or ‘Odd’. We call this a _constant time_ algorithm, because the time the algorithm takes to complete doesn't depend on the size of the input number. It might take different computers different amounts of time to get this result, but that’s due to other factors and not the length of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The steps of an algorithm that works out if a number is even or odd](images/why-qc/odd-even-algo.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a different example. This time, the input is two numbers of equal length, and the problem is to add them together. In this case the output will be a new number. When adding two multi-digit numbers, a common algorithm you probably learnt at school starts with the rightmost digit from each number and adds them together. It then moves one digit to the left (carrying over a ‘1’ if the result was greater than 9) and repeats the process. The computer repeats this until there are no more digits to add, and the algorithm ends.\n",

    "Let’s say the only way we can check if our answer is correct is by punching it into a keypad.

    "\n",
    "How long would this take? Now, in theory we could get lucky and guess the answer in one go, but this is very unlikely. On average, we’d have to try around half the possible inputs, so the running time of our algorithm is proportional to the number of possible combinations. The question now becomes: How does the number of possible combinations grow with the length of the secret number?\n",

Assuming the time taken to guess each digit takes the same amount of time (regardless of the length), we can represent this mathematically like so:\n",

    "## Why do we measure algorithms like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different computers have different strengths; certain operations might be faster on one computer than another. By studying growth vs input size, we can ignore device-specific details and actually measure the _algorithm_, instead of the specific combination of algorithm and computer. Importantly, knowing how an algorithm scales with input size also tells us whether the algorithm will grow manageably or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s think about the linear-time addition algorithm we saw above. If we could add two 10-digit numbers in one second, due to the linear rate of growth, we should be able to add two 20-digit numbers in two seconds. Each extra 10 digits should add roughly one more second to our computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To contrast, imagine you could find a 10-digit PIN in 1 second using the exponential-time search algorithm above. This means your computer is fast enough to try \\~5,000,000,000 combinations per second. We would expect this computer using this algorithm to take roughly 5,000,000,000 seconds (\\~150 years) to find a 20-digit PIN. Adding another 10 digits increases this to around 150,000,000,000 years (\\~120x the age of the universe). Exponential-time algorithms with even a modestly sized input (in this case \\~30 digits) can become not just difficult, but literally impossible to carry out.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this PIN-finding problem is an artificial example we intended to be as simple as possible, there are many real problems in computer science for which we only have inefficient algorithms. Despite the impressive speed of today’s computers, these [intractable](gloss:intractable) problems can be too difficult for even the largest supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we can find algorithms that grow more efficiently, these intractable problems may suddenly become manageable, even with relatively slow or unreliable computers. This is where quantum computing comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can quantum computing help?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have thought of algorithms in a very abstract way, but the computers that execute these algorithms must exist in the real world. Whether these computers are high-powered microchips, or humans with pens and paper, all computers are ultimately governed by the laws of physics, and the operations they can perform limit the algorithms we can create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is an attempt to work out the set of rules everything in the universe follows. Around the early 20th century, through delicate experiments in laboratories, physicists saw strange behaviours which their current physics could not explain. This meant the rules weren’t quite accurate, so they developed the more complete ‘quantum’ physics, which describes this behaviour very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physicists created quantum physics to explain behaviour they'd never seen before, and computer scientists found they could (in theory) exploit this newly discovered behaviour to create more efficient algorithms. As a result, there are certain problems that we believe are intractable for conventional computers, but are manageable for a ‘quantum’ computer that can exploit this behaviour. One such problem is _integer factorisation_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have an integer we'll call '$x$'. A factorizing algorithm finds the integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p×q = x$. This is sometimes easy; you can tell at a glance that $2000 = 2 × 1000$, but if $x$ is the product of two large prime numbers, this problem becomes very difficult. When we talk about integer factorisation, we’re going to assume the most difficult (worst-case) scenario. In the code cell below, we’re assigning a 250-digit number to the variable <code>x</code>:"

The second is the error rate of our quantum computer; since we only see quantum behaviour in delicate laboratory experiments, creating quantum computers is a delicate process. The quantum computers we have right now are noisy, which means they often get things wrong and introduce ‘[noise](gloss:noise)’ into our results. Too much noise and our results will be nonsense!\n",
